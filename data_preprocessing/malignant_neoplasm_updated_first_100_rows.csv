was present on chest radiographs approximately one year ago. Diffuse nodules
throughout the remaining lungs predominate in the middle lobe, right middle
lobe and right lower lobe with relative sparing of the left lower lobe and
lung apices.  These nodules range in size from 1 to 4 mm.  A right pleural
effusion is minimal, and no pathologically enlargement of mediastinal or
axillary lymph nodes is present.The airways are widely patent to subsegmental
level bilaterally. The aorta, and heart size are normal with no pericardial
effusion. Calcification is severe in the coronary arteries, the pulmonary
artery is normal.

A fatty structure appears adherent to the lateral right atrial wall abutting
an area of atrial calcification could be an interatrial lipoma.

pneumonia.

COMPARISON:  ___, and ___, and ___.

TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the chest was performed
without intravenous contrast.  A 1.25- and 5-mm axial and sagittal and
coronally reformatted images were created.

FINDINGS:  Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and bronchiolar nodules,
and dense consolidations within the lingula and right middle lobe worsened
progressively over the past five months and there are several new lesions of
each variety.  The most extensive and longstanding consolidation, in the right
lower lobe basal segments is largely unchanged over more than a year, while
progressive intralobular septal thickening in the superior segment, likely
reflecting lymphangitic spread of tumor, has spread.  Diffuse moderately
severe centrilobular emphysema is unchanged.  

Mild cardiomegaly, a left atrial intramural lipoma, dense atherosclerotic
calcification of the coronary arteries, aortic arch and descending aorta are
all unchanged.  Numerous small mediastinal lymph nodes are stable in number
and size, without mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The pleural and
pericardial surfaces are normal.  The trachea and bronchi to segmental levels
are patent.

No lesions suspicious for malignancy are noted in the imaged chest cage. 
Median sternotomy wires are unchanged. Multilevel degenerative changes noted
throughout the spine.

Although this study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, images
of the upper abdomen demonstrate low-density lesions within the kidneys
bilaterally consistent with renal cysts.  Gallstones are identified within the
gallbladder.


IMPRESSION:

1.  Interval worsening of diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities,
bronchiolar nodules and dense consolidation within the lingula and right
middle lobe. After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays and CTs, these
findings can all be explained by worsening bronchioalveolar carcinoma, given
the absence of any change rapid enough to suggest pneumonia.  Of course
pneumonia might be present and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on
the basis of clinical findings.

2.  Stable mild cardiomegaly.

3.  Moderate emphysema.

4.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

These findings were posted to the online record of critical imaging results on

SINGLE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is a massive right pleural effusion
with a small remnant right upper lung remaining aerated.  Interstitial opacity
is noted in the right lung which may be due to crowding and edema, although
lymphangiitic spread of tumor is not excluded.  A larger geogrpahic area of
consolidation is noted in the left mid and lower lung.  Given the history of
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, this could represent an extension of that
process though a superimposed infectious process is not excluded.  Median
sternotomy wires are intact.

Denser and larger consolidation of the left lung, possibly extension of tumor
or focal, acute infiltrate, or combination thereof.

FINDINGS: 

There are postsurgical changes of left frontal craniotomy with susceptibility
artifacts from the left supraclinoid ICA aneurysm clip.

There is a large, lobulated, heterogenous enhancing mass in the left
cerebellar hemisphere which demonstrates central intrinsic T1 hyperintensity
with central susceptibility artifact, compatible with blood products and/or
calcification.  The periphery of the mass demonstrates slow diffusion,
indicating hypercellularity.  The mass measures approximately 3.1 x 3.1 x 2.8
cm (AP, transverse, SI) on images 14:42 and 100:144.  There is significant
surrounding vasogenic edema, resulting in partial effacement of the left
quadrigeminal cistern and mild effacement of bilateral prepontine cistern. 
The fourth ventricle is displaced to the right and partially effaced. 
Cerebral aqueduct remains patent.

The lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the bilateral temporal horns
are slightly enlarged, disproportionate to the size of the cerebral sulci. 
There is nonspecific T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular white
matter along the lateral ventricles and along the cerebral aqueduct, which may
reflect transependymal CSF flow versus chronic small vessel ischemic changes. 
There also T2/FLAIR hyperintense foci in the deep and subcortical white matter
of the cerebral hemispheres, nonspecific but likely sequela of chronic small
vessel ischemic changes in this age group.

There is mild cortical volume loss in the left superior frontal gyrus, which
may be secondary to prior infarction.

No additional enhancing intracranial lesions are identified.  No evidence for
an acute infarction. Major arterial flow voids are grossly preserved.  Dural
venous sinuses are patent on postcontrast MP RAGE images.

Status post left cataract surgery.  Small amount of fluid in the left
maxillary sinus.

IMPRESSION:


1. 3.1 cm heterogenously enhancing mass with blood products plus/minus
calcifications.  In the setting of the pulmonary lesions suspicious for
malignancy seen on the ___ CT, this may represent a metastasis.

quadrigeminal plate cistern, as well as displacement and partial effacement of
the fourth ventricle.
3. At least mild hydrocephalus involving the lateral and third ventricles with
periventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintensity which may represent transependymal CSF

COMPARISON:  CT head from outside institution ___ at 12:42.

FINDINGS: 

There is a 3.3 x 3.2 x 2.8 cm left cerebellar hemispheric mass which
demonstrates central calcification, peripheral enhancement and areas of
central hypoenhancement/necrosis.  There is extensive surrounding vasogenic
edema with rightward shift of the cerebellar hemisphere by approximately 5 mm
and mass effect on the fourth ventricle which is only slightly patent.  The
ambient cisterns and prepontine cisterns are also effaced.

The ventricular size and configuration is similar to prior study, however does
appear dilated disproportionally when compared to the sulcal space, which
appear diffusely effaced considering patient's age.  These findings suggest
obstructive hydrocephalus.  Addition, there is transependymal flow along the
frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.

There is no evidence of acute large territorial infarction or acute
intracranial hemorrhage.  Small areas of encephalomalacia noted in the left
frontal lobe as well as scattered subcortical white matter hypodensities,
likely sequela of chronic small vessel disease.  In the left frontal lobe.

There is evidence of a left frontal craniotomy with a left paraclinoid
metallic aneurysm coil.  Otherwise, no acute osseous abnormalities seen. 
There is a small air-fluid level in left maxillary sinus.  Otherwise, the
remaining partially imaged paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle
ear cavities are clear. The orbits demonstrate no acute abnormalities.

ABDOMEN:

HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. 
There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is mild intra and extrahepatic
bile duct dilation which is new since the ___ CT.  The distal CBD,
within the pancreatic head, demonstrates internal density (series 2, image
61), which appears confluent with an ill-defined retroperitoneal soft tissue
mass which encases the aorta (series 2, image 63), with poor differentiation
from the adjacent second and third portions of the duodenum (series 2, image
68).  This encasing soft tissue extends along the course of the abdominal
aorta (series 2, image 72) and proximal right and left common iliac arteries
(series 2, image 80).

PANCREAS: The pancreas demonstrates normal attenuation.  However, the
retroperitoneal soft tissue mass described above contacts the pancreatic head,
and it is unclear whether not there is local invasion (series 2, image 64).

SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without
evidence of focal lesions.

COMPARISON:  No relevant prior comparisons.

FINDINGS: 

There is an ill-defined mass demonstrating increased T2 signal intensity
involving predominantly the right aspect of the anus.  The mass extends
posteriorly and crosses midline at the anal verge (series 200, image 83), and
encompasses nearly the entire right aspect of the internal sphincter. In
transaxial ___ it measures approximately 2.6 x 1.7 cm (07:23).  The
mass extends superiorly into the lower rectum, up to 7 cm above the anal
verge, where it appears to cross midline again (series 200, image 50) with
obscuration of both the internal and external sphincters at 1:00 to 3:00 and
suspected extension into the left mesorectal fat (series 7, image 14). The fat
plane between the mass and vagina remains preserved.

The patient is post hysterectomy. A 1.5 x 1.0 cm T1 hyperintense and T2
hypointense lesion arising from the left aspect of the vaginal cuff is likely
a small hematoma (series 7, image 7, series 10 image 45).

There are no suspicious pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes. No free fluid is

INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with rectal cancer  // need to determine exact
staging and depth of rectal mass invasion preoperatively and to plan for XRT

TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the pelvis is obtained at 1.5 Tesla per the
rectal mass protocol. T1 and T2 weighted sequences are acquired both pre and
post administration of 8 mL of gadavist. 1 mg of intramuscular glucagon was
administered to decreased bowel peristalsis.

COMPARISON:  MRI of the pelvis dating ___. Also CT abdomen pelvis
dating ___.

FINDINGS: 

As was seen on the prior examination, there is a large mass replacing the
majority of the anus. Total anterior to posterior extent of tumor now measures
6.5 cm, increased from prior 5.4 cm.  The mass is predominantly T2
hyperintense with restricted diffusion (6:74). Peripheral enhancement is
present (200:28). Anteriorly and on the left, this replaces the internal
sphincter, while posteriorly and on the right, the mass involves both internal
and external sphincter, with extension posteriorly and to the ischial anal
fossa and subcutaneous tissues of the right buttock. The tumor now extends
further posteriorly to the skin surface (08:22).  The degree of anal sphincter
involvement classifies the rectal tumor as T3.

There is also abnormality of the distal rectum, predominantly the posterior
wall, which is thickened and hyperenhancing. Unlike the anal component, this
wall thickening is T2 hypointense (09:14). Based on mucinous adenocarcinoma
pathology, this distal rectal abnormality likely represents the site of tumor
origin with inferior extension and mucinous differentiation. There is
irregularity of the left posterior lateral distal rectal wall with abnormal
enhancement extending posteriorly to the levator ani muscle and mesorectal
fascia (200:55), although consistent with T3 tumor stage.  While this abuts
the muscle, there is no definitive involvement. Anterior to the left aspect of
the distal rectum there is also adjacent irregularity, as previously
described.  The appearance is stable as compared to prior.

Small perirectal nodes are present on the right (200:61, 71, 77).  None
measure greater than 4 mm, therefore do not have imaging appearance of
malignant involvement.   Pelvic sidewall nodes are also identified, left
greater than right.  These are neither pathologically enlarged, nor
demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement to suggest tumor involvement.  Inguinal
nodes are slightly asymmetric, left larger than right, but also are not
pathologically enlarged and do not demonstrate concerning enhancement
(200:55).  No definitively pathologic nodes are identified within the pelvis.

There is no tumor invasion of the vagina or bladder.

There is diffuse subcutaneous as third spacing of fluid (8: 25). There are
small bilateral hip joint effusions and a synovial hyperenhancement. No
concerning osseous lesion is appreciated.

The patient is status post hysterectomy. There is re- demonstration of focus
of T1 hyperintense, nonenhancing material at the left aspect of the vaginal
cuff, likely representing residual proteinaceous or hemorrhagic material. The
vagina, urinary bladder and urethra are unremarkable.

reformatted and reviewed.

CT CHEST:

There is a left-sided pacer device with leads in unchanged position.  Again
demonstrated are multiple left-sided rib fractures involving ribs one through
ten, unchanged.  There is a left pleural effusion which has not increased
significantly in size from most recent prior study.  This fluid measures
higher in attenuation than simple fluid and likely contains blood products
with nothing to suggest active extravasation.  There is atelectasis of left
lower lobe as seen on prior.  The right lung remains essentially clear with
atelectasis versus scarring at the posterior right lung base.  There is no
pericardial effusion.  No mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Questionable fracture
deformities of right fifth through seventh ribs as previously described.

identified with findings suggestive of vertebral body hemangioma in T12 and
L3.

CT ABDOMEN:

The liver, spleen, adrenal glands and pancreas are normal in appearance. 
There is a partially exophytic cyst involving the upper pole of left kidney
which is high-attenuation on the comparison, CT abdomen without contrast,
suggesting this represents a hemorrhagic cyst as was previously described.

as previously described.  In addition, there is a non-displaced fracture of
the left clavicle near the sternoclavicular junction.

3.  There is a lytic lesion in the distal left clavicle adjacent to the
acromioclavicular joint which appears new from a radiograph in ___ and is
concerning for a metastatic focus.  Decreased attenuation in the T4 vertebral

sagittal reformations were obtained.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The visualized heart and pericardium are
unremarkable without evidence of pericardial effusion.  There are small
bilateral pleural effusions, left larger than right, with associated
atelectasis of the adjacent lung.  Ill-defined nodular opacities are present
in the lingula, which may reflect atelectasis. Sub 4-mm pulmonary nodules are
scattered throughout the right lower lobe (2:11, 2:12).

The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and right adrenal gland are unremarkable.
There is a small calcified splenic artery aneurysm, at the level of the hilum.
Otherwise, the spleen is unremarkable.

The patient is status post left nephrectomy with surgical clips seen within
the nephrectomy bed without evidence for abnormal soft tissue density. The
left adrenal gland is thickened diffusely, without a discrete nodule. The
right kidney contains scattered rounded hypodensities, too small to
characterize, but likely reflecting renal cysts.

The stomach and small bowel are normal.  There are three rounded lesions that
appear relatively dense/enhancing, adjacent to the ascending colon and
transverse colon.  (2:36, 2:39, 2:54).  Two of the lesions appear to
demonstrate a rim of air, suggesting that these may reflect diverticula. There
is no free air.  Few scattered retroperitoneal nodes are seen, not
pathologically enlarged.

There is atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Foley catheter is in the bladder with small
locules of air seen within the bladder, likely related to instrumentation.
There is a large amount of stool seen within the rectum.  No pelvic
lymphadenopathy is identified.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  The bones are diffusely osteopenic.  Only partially

overall similar to ___. Multiple pulmonary metastases are
re-demonstrated in the remaining visualized lung bases.

ABDOMEN:

HEPATOBILIARY:  Innumerable metastatic lesions are re-demonstrated in the
liver, the largest of which appears to be a conglomerate of masses spanning an
area of 5.9 x 6.7 cm in segment VIII (5:25). The gallbladder is within normal
limits, without stones or gallbladder wall thickening.

PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of
focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  There is no peripancreatic
stranding.

SPLEEN:  The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without
evidence of focal lesions.

ADRENALS:  The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.

URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. 
There is a 6 mm hypodensity in the lower pole of the right kidney (5:43) that
this too small to characterize but most likely represents a cyst. There is no
evidence of stones, suspicious renal masses or hydronephrosis. There are no
urothelial lesions in the kidneys or ureters. There is no perinephric
abnormality.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall
thickness and enhancement throughout. Since the prior CT on ___,
there has been interval placement of a stent in the rectosigmoid colon. Soft
tissue mass encasing the stent is compatible with known malignancy.  Anterior
and inferior to the stent, there is a 10.4 x 7.4 cm (5:66) circumscribed fluid
collection containing small locules of gas, suggestive of stent perforation.
There is also a moderate/large amount of free air along the right aspect of
the stent as well as more superiorly in the peritoneal cavity.  Small amount
of ascites also noted.

RETROPERITONEUM:  There is extensive abdominal lymphadenopathy. Notably, there
is a large conglomerate of necrotic lymph nodes in the porta hepatis (5:29),
which appears overall unchanged since the prior study in ___. This
results in narrowing of the origin of the left renal vein (5:27).  It also
encases the splenic vein-SMV confluence and bilateral renal arteries (5:26),
but do not result in significant intraluminal narrowing of these vessels.

VASCULAR:  There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Extensive atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted in the abdominal aorta and bilateral iliac branches.

identified. Abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: 

1.  Interval (since ___ placement of a colonic stent,
2.  Circumscribed 10.4 x 7.4mm anterior pelvic fluid collection containing
small locules of gas, likely an abscess from sigmoid tumor perforation.   This
is amenable to drainage.
2a.  Moderate/large amount of free air, and small amount of free fluid within
the peritoneum.
3. Extensive lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum and porta hepatis, which
results in narrowing of the origin of the left renal vein. Encasement of the

parenchymal lesions identified.  No main duct dilatation.

SPLEEN: The spleen is enlarged at 15 cm in longest diameter.  No focal splenic
lesions are identified.

ADRENALS: Adrenal glands are normal.

URINARY: There is minimal lobulation of the left kidney, potentially related
to prior infarct/infection.  Renal parenchyma otherwise unremarkable.  No
focal parenchymal lesions.  No hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.

GASTROINTESTINAL: As seen on colonoscopy, a large fungating mass identified at
the level of the lower rectum.  Although difficult to measure, this mass
extends at least 8 cm above the anorectal junction and nearly completely
occludes the lumen of the rectum, mass measures up to 6.2  cm in AP dimension
and 7 cm in transverse dimension.  No gross extension beyond the muscularis
propria, although assessment with CT is limited in this regard.  There is
minimal distension of the rectosigmoid just above the level of the mass,
suggesting some element of obstruction.  Large bowel caliber normalizes
progressively more proximally.  Oral contrast has reached the descending
colon.  Scattered uncomplicated diverticula are seen in the right and left
hemicolon.  Appendix in the right lower quadrant is normal.  Terminal ileum in

1. Known large rectal mass re-demonstrated, extending at least 8 cm above the
anorectal junction.  Exact ___ are difficult to determine on CT.  Mass
nearly completely occludes the lumen of the rectum but does not cause overt
large-bowel obstruction.
2. No evidence of metastatic disease to the abdomen or pelvis.
3. Diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall.  In the absence of an elevated
white blood count, this finding may be related to third spacing.  Additional
note is made of mild periportal edema and small volume free fluid around the
liver and spleen.  There is no evidence of peritoneal deposits to substantiate
presence of ascites.  Findings are likely again related to third spacing.
4. The spleen is enlarged (15 cm).  No focal parenchymal lesions are
identified.  No associated lymphadenopathy.

FINDINGS: 

LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no
evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  The previously seen bilateral
pleural effusions have resolved.

ABDOMEN:

HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout.  A
1.2 cm hypodensity in segment 4A is unchanged from prior study when measured
in similar planes (02:15).  There is no evidence of intrahepatic or
extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  Pneumobilia and air within the gallbladder
are related to the widely patent CBD stent.  The gallbladder contains air and
layering debris, likely small stones or sludge and is otherwise unremarkable.

PANCREAS: The pancreas is normal in attenuation throughout.  The main
pancreatic duct is mildly prominent.  The subtle hypodensity in the pancreatic
head is unchanged with near complete resolution of previously seen soft tissue
density contacting the SMA and SMV.  There is no peripancreatic stranding.

SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without
evidence of focal lesions.

ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.

URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. 
Renal cortical hypodensities bilaterally are too small fully characterize but
likely represent simple cysts, unchanged from the prior study.  Hypodensities
in the renal pelvis likely represent peripelvic renal cysts, also unchanged. 
There is no suspicious focal renal lesion.  There is no hydronephrosis.  There
is no perinephric abnormality.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel loops demonstrate
normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  The colon and
rectum are within normal limits.  The appendix is normal.

PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.  There is no
free fluid in the pelvis.

REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Uterus contains an unchanged hyperenhancing fibroid
measuring up to 1.4 cm (2:61).  The left adnexal venous structures are
prominent and dilated with dilatation of the left gonadal vein (2:30, 65).

SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.

IMPRESSION:


1. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Pancreatic head hypodensity is unchanged and associated peripancreatic soft
tissue density is less conspicuous, potentially due to interval improvement or
differences in technique.
3. Left pelvic vein engorgement and left gonadal vein enlargement are
nonspecific findings but may be seen in the setting of pelvic congestion
syndrome.

Omnipaque intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal relations are displayed
with 5-mm slice thickness.

CT ABDOMEN:  The visualized lung bases demonstrate bibasilar subsegmental
atelectasis, slightly increased from ___.  There is no pleural or
pericardial effusion.

The liver is unremarkable.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct
dilation.  The gallbladder is normal.  A subtle peripheral wedge-shaped
hypodensity in the inferior spleen is new compared to ___ and raises
concern for a splenic infarction (601b:33).  

The pancreas enhances homogenously. Again seen are four well-positioned
double-J transgastrostomy stents, unchanged in position from ___.  There
has been interval removal of the nasogastric tube. A fluid collection at the
splenic hilum is 2.0 x 1.7 cm, previously 3.0 x 1.9 cm, smaller but with a new
focus of air (2:22). No oral contrast is seen within it, but adjacent
inflammatory change abuts the stomach and a small fistulous connection cannot
be excluded. Just inferior to this, a peripancreatic collection is 3.7 x 1.8
cm, previously 4.8 x 2.2 cm, smaller, with similar tethering of adjacent
bowel. A right posterolateral fluid collection has decreased, now measuring
4.1 x 1.3 cm, previously 6.0 x 2.1 cm. There has been interval removal of the
drain within it. A hyperdensity within the subcutaneous tract of the drain is
noted (2:47, 48). Gastric wall thickening along the lesser curvature is
slightly increased compared to ___, nonspecific and may relate to
distention. No new peripancreatic fluid collection is identified. 

The bilateral adrenal glands are normal, although the left adrenal gland abuts
some inflammatory change.   The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete
contrast without hydronephrosis. There is no bowel obstruction.  The patient
is status post colostomy in the left lower quadrant.  Diverticula are seen in
the large bowel. Multiple injection granulomas are seen in the right anterior
abdominal wall subcutaneous tissues. The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber
throughout. The main portal vein and SMV are patent. The splenic vein is not
opacified, unchanged. 

CT PELVIS:  The rectum pouch is unremarkable.  The sigmoid colon is absent. 
The bladder and uterus are unremarkable.  There is no free fluid and no pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: A 2.8 x 1.4cm right iliac lucency with possible cortical break
through is more conspicuous than on ___ and ___. Compression
deformity of T11 is unchanged.  Degenerative changes, predominantly at L4-L5
and L5-S1 are similar to the prior study. 
 
IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval decrease in size of peripancreatic fluid collections compared to
___.  Superinfection of the collections cannot be excluded.  The
collection at the splenic hilum contains a new small focus of air. Although
there is no oral contrast within it, a fistula to stomach or bowel cannot be
excluded.

2.  No new peripancreatic fluid collection.  Homogenous enhancement of the
pancreas.

3.  Subtle wedge shaped hypodensity in the inferior spleen raises concern for
a new splenic infarct.

4.  High density in the subcutaneous tissues of the right posterolateral drain
tract. Correlate with physical exam for retained catheter fragment.

5.  Destructive appearing right iliac lucency, possibly with cortical
breakthrough. Given the history of breast cancer, this is concerning for a
metastatic focus.

Multiplanar reformats were derived.

FINDINGS:

CTA OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

The patient is status post thyroidectomy.  Paramediastinal lung apices
demonstrate scarring and traction bronchiectasis consistent with post-
radiation changes.  There is no axillary adenopathy.  A subcarinal node is
more prominent on today's study (series 2, image 24) measuring to 11 mm. The
pulmonary artery is normal in caliber 2.6 cm.  The aorta is normal in caliber
and course.  The heart is top normal in size.  There is no pericardial
effusion.

The trachea and bilateral main bronchi are patent.  Previously demonstrated
secretions are absent today.  There is mucoid impaction of subsegmental
bronchi to the right lower lobe (see for example series 2, image 37).
Peripheral to this, a nodular consolidative opacification is seen (series 2,
image 46).  In the right upper lobe (2, image 20) consolidative opacification
with proximal centrolobular nodularity suggests an infectious etiology.
Nodular opacification in the right middle lobe is also consistent with an
infectious etiology.  A consolidative opacity is seen in the right perihilar
area (series 2, image 35).  In the left lung, there is mild basilar
atelectasis. Small pulmonary nodules seen at the apex (series 4, image 23,
30).  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

This study is not optimized for visualizing the abdomen.  The liver,
gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenals are grossly normal.  The kidneys
symmetrically take up and excrete contrast.  There are multiple hypodensities
seen within the left kidney, likely represent cysts.  Calcification in the
splenic hilum likely represents calcified splenic artery aneurysm.

MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Well-marginated structures in the vertebral bodies of polka-
dot appearance are likely hemangioma.  Small 3-mm sclerotic focus in the mid
thoracic vertebra is indeterminate.

IMPRESSION:  Multifocal consolidation in the right lung with mucoid impaction
and associated nodularity suggests an infectious process.  Coexistent
metastatic disease cannot be assessed.  Recommend repeat chest CT after
treatment has been completed.

Left apical pulmonary nodules which can be evaluated on the followup chest CT.

Indeterminate sclerotic apparently new focus in the mid thoracic vertebrae. 
Uncharacteristic for a papillary thyroid metastasis.  Recommend attention to
this area on followup.

COMPARISON:  Diagnostic chest CT dated ___ and ___.
Correlation made to PET-CT dated ___.

FINDINGS: 

The thyroid gland is unremarkable.  Multiple mildly prominent mediastinal
lymph nodes measure up to 10 mm in short axis in the right lower paratracheal
station (3, 27). There are no pathologically enlarged supraclavicular,
axillary or hilar lymph nodes.

Mild cardiomegaly with multichamber enlargement is stable. The patient is
status post median sternotomy with CABG. Extensive native and grafted coronary
artery calcifications are present. The main pulmonary artery and thoracic
aorta are normal caliber. Diffuse low attenuation of the blood within the
heart suggests anemia. There is no pericardial effusion. Moderate to severe
calcific atherosclerosis diffusely involves the thoracic aorta and its
branches. An abdominal aortic stent graft is partially imaged. Images of the
upper abdomen are otherwise unremarkable.

Moderate apical predominant centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema is
unchanged. Basal predominant fibrotic changes are partially obscured by new
small bilateral layering pleural effusions. There are new bilateral upper lobe
ground-glass opacities.  Ground-glass opacities respect the major fissure in
the right upper lobe, but have less well-defined borders in the left upper
lobe and show peripheral sparing.  Diffuse bronchial wall thickening is most
pronounced in the bilateral lower lobes, where there are also peribronchial
consolidations and ___ opacities. There is also a new 8 mm anterior
right upper lobe nodular opacity with irregular borders (6, 172). A left
apical nodular opacity with irregular borders has grown since ___
measuring 9 x 21 mm, and is contiguous with left apical subsegmental
ground-glass opacities (6, 64). Two 3 mm left upper lobe solid nodules are
stable since ___, and presumed benign (6, 140 and 156).  Several
punctate calcified granulomas are unchanged. Extensive layering retained
secretions are again noted in the trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi.
Mucous plugging contributes to new left lower lobe partial atelectasis.

There has been marked interval growth of the known anterior chest wall lesion
since ___, which now involves much of the sternum. Sternal cortical
destruction has increased. The lesion now measures 6.5 x 3.9 x 8.3 cm,
previously 5.6 x 3.8 x 4.6 cm (TV x AP x CC:  3, 20 and 9, 81). Generalized
osteopenia and multilevel spinal degenerative changes are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: 

Interval growth of ng left anterior chest wall mass since ___ with
increased cortical destruction of the sternum

New bilateral upper lobe ground-glass opacities. The left upper lobe
abnormality is nonanatomic in distribution and may be due to radiation
pneumonitis. However, the dependent segmental distribution of the right upper
lobe abnormality is more suggestive of aspiration or infection.

or hilar lymphadenopathy.  Esophagus is unremarkable.

Heart size is normal without pericardial effusion.  The thoracic aorta and
proximal great vessels are normal in caliber with mild scattered
atherosclerosis.  The main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber.  There is
moderate atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries most notably the left main
and LAD.

The tracheobronchial tree is patent to the subsegmental level.  Evaluation of
the lung parenchyma is limited by respiratory motion.  There is
mild-to-moderate bronchial wall thickening with retained secretions.  Multiple
centrilobular nodules in the left upper lobe may be smoking related. 
Atelectasis in the right middle lobe, right lower lobe, lingula and left lower

STUDY:  CTA of the chest; MDCT images were generated through the chest without
IV contrast.  Subsequent MDCT images were generated through the chest after
the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast.  Coronal,
sagittal, and right and lateral oblique reformatted images were also
generated.

COMPARISON:  ___.

FINDINGS:  No axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.  There is extensive
mediastinal lymphadenopathy, overall increased since the prior examination,
including in the paratracheal, AP window, precarinal, subcarinal, and
prevascular spaces.  For example, AP window enlarged lymph node on series 3,
image 50 today measures 1.7 x 1.7 cm compared to 1.3 x 1.2 cm previously. 
Subcarinal lymph node conglomerate today measures 3.4 x 3.1 cm (Se3:___)
compared to 3.3 x 2.7 cm previously. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is also
seen.  Partially calcified right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy is again
seen.

The aorta demonstrates no evidence of intramural hematoma or dissection.
Evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary artery branches in the lower lobes is
suboptimal due to patient motion artifact.  No concerning filling defect is
seen in the remainder of the pulmonary arteries.  The lungs demonstrate
multiple foci of spiculated opacities, involving all lobes, consistent with
metastatic disease.  Many of these opacities have increased in size from prior
study.  For example, anterior right upper lobe subpleural lesion today
measures 3.0 x 2.0 cm (Se___) compared to 2.2 x 1.7 cm previously.  Right
lower lobe opacity measuring 2.6 x 1.9 cm (___) measured 2.0 x 1.9 cm
previously.  Additionally, new foci of opacity (ie. right lower lobe image 74
and left lower lobe image 69) are seen either signifying new metastatic areas
or new areas of infection. A small right pleural effusion is noted.  No
pericardial effusion is seen.

Although this exam is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, lesions in
the liver are seen consistent with metastases.  A small amount of perihepatic
fluid is seen.

BONES:  The superior portion of the sternum demonstrates a large lytic soft
tissue mass that nearly completely obliterates the sternum and extends into
the soft tissues, previously biopsy proven metastatic adenocarcinoma, and
which appears increased.  Additionally, at the superior aspect of the
vertebral body of L1, there is a lytic lesion measuring 1.6 x 1.3 cm,
increased in size from the prior study when it measured 1.0 x 0.8 cm.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Auboptimal evaluation of the subsegmental pulmonary arteries in the lung
bases due to patient respiratory motion.  Otherwise, no evidence of PE in the
more central pulmonary arteries.  No evidence of acute aortic syndrome.
2.  Interval progression of metastases including pulmonary, mediastinal, and
osseous.  New areas of pulmonary opacity may represent new/increased pulmonary
metastases although new areas of infection are not excluded.
3.  Small amount of perihepatic fluid.  Hepatic metastases, difficult to
compare to prior given differences in technique.

unchanged compared to the CT scan performed the prior day.  A small right-
sided pleural effusion is unchanged.  Confluent hypodense lesions are seen
within both hepatic lobes and have increased in size compared to the prior
study of ___.  For example, a right hepatic lobe lesion (series 3:22)
now measures 6.0 x 4.3 cm and previously measured 4.9 x 4.0 cm.  A few coarse
calcifications are seen within the right hepatic lobe.  There is no definite
portal vein thrombus.  

The gallbladder is mildly distended with layering sludge.  Scattered
calcifications within the spleen likely reflect prior granulomatous disease.  

A large hypodense exophytic lesion arising from the pancreatic tail measures
5.9 x 5.1 cm and appears to be contiguous with the left adrenal gland.  The
lesion encompasses the splenic artery and splenic vein which are poorly
visualized.  Multiple collateral vessels are noted.  The mass extends to the
left renal vein (series, 3:24) and anterior left renal cortex.  Multiple
enlarged peripancreatic nodes are noted.  A confluent nodal mass surrounds the
hepatic artery (series 3:24).  Enlarged lymph nodes are also seen within the
gastrohepatic ligament and adjacent to the esophagus.  A 13-mm necrotic nodule
is seen slightly inferior to the left kidney (series 3:42).  A small left
paracolic gutter nodule is also noted (3:46).  There is diffuse omental
studding (series 3:42).  A small amount of fluid tracks along the right
paracolic gutter.  There is no free air within the abdomen.

Limited examination of the vascular structures demonstrates atherosclerotic
calcifications.

FINDINGS: 

The patient has undergone prior coiling of a left PCOM aneurysm, which results
in a large amount of streak artifact.  Study is also degraded by motion. 
Within these confines:

There is no definite intracranial hemorrhage, acute large vascular territorial
infarction, edema, or mass.  Previously described areas of hyperdensity
throughout the left cerebral hemisphere have resolved over the interval. 
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with sequela of
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  Punctate areas of fat bilaterally
within the sulci and ventricular system are stable.  Ventricles and sulci are
stable in size and configuration.

There is no evidence of fracture.  The visualized portion of the paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The visualized
portion of the orbits are unremarkable. Soft tissue densities are noted within
bilateral external auditory canals which may represent cerumen.

IMPRESSION:


1. Left PCOM aneurysm coil mass streak artifact and motion moderately limits
examination.
2. Within limits of study, no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Grossly stable punctate bihemispheric sulcal and intraventricular fat. 
Question history of ruptured dermoid or epidermoid tumor versus multiple small
lipomas.
4. Please note MRI of the brain is more sensitive for the detection of acute
infarct.

PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and
alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the
health care proxy. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and
placed supine on the exam table.  A pre-procedure time-out was performed per
___ protocol. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile
fashion.

Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, the right common femoral artery was
punctured using a micropuncture set at the level of the mid-femoral head. A
0.018 wire was passed easily into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was
made over the needle. Then the inner dilator and wire were removed and a
___ wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The micropuncture
sheath was exchanged for a 5 ___ sheath which was attached to a continuous
heparinized saline side arm flush.

A MIK catheter was advanced over ___ wire into the aorta. The wire was
removed and the common trunk of the celiac and SMA arteries was selectively
cannulated and a small contrast injection was made to confirm position. A
celiacarteriogram was performed. A ___ microcatheter pre-loaded
with a Transcend wire was used to access the splenic artery.  The
microcatheter was parked in the mid to distal splenic artery and gelfoam
embolization to slow flow was performed at this level.  A post-embolization

splenic and portal veins which appears thrombosed and occluded, unchanged in
appearance relative to study dated ___.  Best appreciated on the
coronal sequence 12 image 50, some thrombus extends into the distal main
portal vein.  Similar to prior examination, there is thrombus identified
within the superior mesenteric vein (10:59).

Relative to prior examination, the degree of hemoperitoneum is not
significantly changed.  A perisplenic hematoma is persistently present though
decreased in density suggestive of evolution (10:52).  An Amplatzer device is
again noted within the splenic parenchymal access site (10:36).  There is no
evidence of active extravasation.  Previously heterogeneously dense clot
within the abdominal portions of the hemo peritoneum is no longer present.

A hypodense pancreatic mass a 7.6 x 4.4 x 4.6 cm pancreatic head mass is not
significantly changed in size or appearance. The mass appears to encase the
celiac axis (06:50) as well as a put the superior mesenteric artery (06:54). A
common origin of the celiac and superior mesenteric artery is noted. Again
noted, there is soft tissue infiltration along the greater curvature of the
stomach (06:50) as well as extending along the transverse mesocolon. A 1.1 cm
peripancreatic node (06:57) and 0.6 cm portacaval node are stable in

COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT ___.

FINDINGS: 

The aorta and its major branch vessels are patent, with no evidence of
stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysmal formation.  There is no
evidence of penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or aortic arch atheroma present.

There is suboptimal opacification of the pulmonary arteries.  Within this
limitation, there is no obvious filling defect to suggest a pulmonary embolism
in the main, right, left, or lobar branches.  The main and right pulmonary
arteries are normal in caliber, and there is no evidence of right heart
strain.

There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are severely
enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, including in the right upper paratracheal,
right lower paratracheal, subcarinal, and AP window locations.  Additionally,
there is bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  Centered in the subcarinal space is
a large heterogeneous predominantly low density lesion with central high
density, which may reflect calcifications.  This lesion appears slightly more
heterogeneous compared to the ___ outside hospital study, although
this may be due to differences in timing of this study relative to the outside
hospital exam.  This lesion causes mass effect on the left pulmonary artery
superiorly and the left atrium inferiorly.  This lesion measures approximately
7.9 x 5.8 cm, slightly larger than on the prior study.  There is narrowing of
the right mainstem bronchus.  There has been interval placement of stents in
the left mainstem bronchus and the right bronchus intermedius.    The thyroid
gland appears unremarkable.

The esophagus is fluid-filled starting well above the carina.

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.  There is no pleural effusion.

Hazy ground glass opacities throughout the right upper lobe and right middle
lobe may reflect mild edema.  There is no nodular interlobular septal
thickening.  A new small dependent pleural based area of nodularity in the
superior segment of the right lower lobe may reflect atelectasis.  There is
atelectasis in the left lower lobe and right middle lobe.

Incidental note is made of an accessory left hepatic artery arising from left
gastric artery.  The upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable in appearance.

No lytic or blastic osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy is identified.

IMPRESSION: 

1.  Suboptimal opacification of the pulmonary arteries.  Within this
limitation, no obvious pulmonary embolism.
2.  Large mediastinal mass, slightly larger than on the prior study.  Patent
left mainstem and right bronchus intermedius stents.
3.  Fluid-filled esophagus at the level of carina, which may predispose to
aspiration.

FINDINGS: 

The thyroid is normal. Supraclavicular, axillary, lymph nodes are not
enlarged.  There is confluent mediastinal and bilateral hilar adenopathy. 
Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal size.

No pleural or pericardial effusion.

Large 5.5 x 8.7 x 7.9 cm partially calcified posterior mediastinal mass once
again appreciated, overall similar compared to previous, allowing for
limitations of a noncontrast examination.  There is invasion of the carina and
bilateral mainstem bronchi. There is approximately 50% narrowing of the right
main stem bronchus proximal to the stent over a 2.2 cm segment.  There is
approximately 50% narrowing of the left main stem bronchus, proximal to the
stent over a length of 0.9 cm.  Distally, there is an abrupt cut off of the
left lower lobe bronchus due to confluent soft tissue in the left hilum. 
Overall, this appears similar compared to previous, though there is increased
post obstructive atelectasis in the left lower lobe.  The proximal esophagus
is dilated, and the esophagus is completely obstructed at the level of the
mass, with retained contrast.   Assessment for vascular invasion is poorly
appreciated in this noncontrast examination.

There is increased consolidation and atelectasis within the left lower lobe
compared to previous, reflecting infectious/inflammatory etiology, as well as
worsened left lower lobe bronchial obstruction.

The imaged portion of the upper abdomen is within normal limits.

No worrisome osseous findings.
