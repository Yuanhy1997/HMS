The\npatient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10\nyears.  She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 142/76,\nheart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97%\naxillary temperature.  She was saturating at 100% on CPAP\nwith dry mucous membranes.  An elderly female in no apparent\ndistress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and\naccommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx\ndifficult to assess due to CPAP machine.  No evidence of\njugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP\nmachine obscures the neck exam.  Cranial nerves II through\nXII are grossly intact.  Neck is supple without\nlymphadenopathy.

COPD/dyspnea/pneumonia:  The patient was initially placed\non an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical\nIntensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation\ndespite CPAP machine.  She was also given nebulizer\ntreatments q.4h. as well as chest PT.  The nebulizers were\nincreased to q.1h. due to the fact that she continued to have\nlabored breathing.\n\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing,\nthe patient was intubated on [**2118-6-7**] in order to improve\noxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction.  A\nbronchoscopy was performed on [**2118-6-7**], which demonstrated\nmarked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent\nwith tracheomalacia.\n\nOn [**2118-6-9**], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left\nmain stem (12 x 25 and one in the trachea 16 x 40) by Dr.\n[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\n\nOn [**2118-6-11**], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel\nmask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal\ncannula at which time she was transferred to the medical\nfloor.  On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned to off\non [**2118-6-14**], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2\nliters, 92% on room air.\n\nOn [**2118-6-14**], the patient was seen again by the Interventional\nPulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved\nand recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with\nfollowup within six weeks' time status post placement of\nstents in respiratory failure.\n\n2. Cardiovascular:  The patient was ruled out for a MI.  She\ndid have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain,\nwhich showed no evidence of EKG changes and negative\ntroponin, negative CKs x3.  She was continued on aspirin,\nImdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient\nregimen.\n\n3. Hypertension:  She was maintained on diltiazem and\nhydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and\nnormalization of electrolytes.\n\n4. Hematuria:  The patient had intermittent hematuria likely\nsecondary to Foley placement.  The Foley catheter was\ndiscontinued on [**2118-6-14**].  She had serial urinalyses, which\nwere all negative for signs of infection.\n\n5. Hyperglycemia:  Patient was placed on insulin-sliding\nscale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced.  This\nworked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels\nonce the steroids were tapered to off.\n\n6. Leukocytosis:  Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of\n20 to 22 during much of her hospital course.  As the steroids\nwere tapered to off, her white blood cell count on [**2118-6-14**]\nwas 15,000.  It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary\nto both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe\npneumonia.\n\n7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had\ninitially received a course of levofloxacin 500 p.o. q.d.\nfrom [**2118-6-4**] to [**2118-6-10**].  This was restarted on [**2118-6-12**]\nfor an additional seven day course given the fact that she\nstill had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the\nleft lower lobe.\n\n8. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on outpatient\nmedical regimen.\n\n9. Depression:  The patient was continued on Lexapro per\noutpatient regimen.  It is recommended that she follow up\nwith a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she\ndid have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital\ncourse, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\n\n10. Prophylaxis:  She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor\nwith subQ Heparin.\n\n11. Sore throat:  The patient did have a sore throat for much\nof the hospital course post extubation.  This was treated\nwith Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution\ncontaining Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\n\n12. Communication/code status:  The patient was full code\nthroughout her hospital course, and communication was\nmaintained with the patient and her husband.\n\n13. Muscle weakness:  The patient did have profound muscle\nweakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found\nto have impaired functional mobility, impaired\nmusculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired\nendurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine\nto sit.  However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair\nfor approximately one hour.\n\nOn motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower\nextremities were [**4-8**] at the knee, [**4-8**] at the ankle, [**4-8**] at\nthe elbows, and [**4-8**] hips.  It was felt that this weakness was\nmost likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well\nas muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a\nprolonged hospital course.\n\n14. Speech/swallow:  The patient had a Speech and Swallow\nevaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of\nvocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\n\nDISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was able to oxygenate on\nroom air at 93% at the time of discharge.  She was profoundly\nweak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood\npressure.  Her respirations were much improved albeit with\ntransmitted upper airway sounds.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital1 **]\nfor both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

Two days prior to admission, she was started on a prednisone taper and one day prior to admission she required oxygen at home in order to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%. She has also been on levofloxacin and nebulizers, and was not getting better, and presented to the Emergency Room.\n\nIn the Emergency Room, her oxygen saturation was 100% on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). She was not able to be weaned off of this despite nebulizer treatment and Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenous (IV) x2.\n\n<<<<review of system>>>>\nReview of systems is negative for the following: Fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, night sweats, change in weight, gastrointestinal complaints, neurologic changes, rashes, palpitations, orthopnea. Is positive for the following: Chest pressure occasionally with shortness of breath with exertion, some shortness of breath that is positionally related, but is improved with nebulizer treatment.\n<<<<past medical history>>>>\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Last pulmonary function tests in [Date] demonstrated a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) of 52% of predicted, a Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 54% of predicted, a Maximum Mid-Expiratory Flow (MMF) of 23% of predicted, and a FEV1:FVC ratio of 67% of predicted, that does not improve with bronchodilator treatment. The FVC, however, does significantly improve with bronchodilator treatment consistent with her known reversible air flow obstruction in addition to an underlying restrictive ventilatory defect. The patient has never been on home oxygen prior to this recent episode. She has never been on steroid taper or been intubated in the past.\n2. Lacunar Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA). MRI of the head in [Date] demonstrates \"mild degree of multiple small foci of high T2 signal within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres as well as the pons, in the latter region predominantly to the right of midline. The abnormalities, while nonspecific in etiology, are most likely secondary to chronic microvascular infarction. There is no mass, lesion, shift of the normal midline strictures or hydrocephalus. The major vascular flow patterns are preserved. There is moderate right maxillary, moderate bilateral ethmoid, mild left maxillary, minimal right sphenoid, and frontal sinus mucosal thickening. These abnormalities could represent an allergic or some other type of inflammatory process. Additionally noted is a moderately enlarged subtotally empty sella turcica\".\n3. Angina: Most recent stress test was in [Date] going for four minutes with a rate pressure product of 10,000, 64% of maximum predicted heart rate without evidence of ischemic Electrocardiogram (EKG) changes or symptoms. The imaging portion of the study demonstrated no evidence of myocardial ischemia and a calculated ejection fraction of 84%.

The patient is a prior smoker, but has not smoked in over 10 years. She has no known alcohol use and she is a full code.\n\n<<<<physical exam>>>>\nPHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION: Blood pressure 142/76, heart rate 100 and regular, respirations at 17-21, and 97% axillary temperature. She was saturating at 100% on CPAP with dry mucous membranes. An elderly female in no apparent distress. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements are intact. Oropharynx difficult to assess due to CPAP machine. No evidence of jugular venous pressure, however, the strap from the CPAP machine obscures the neck exam. Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. Heart exam: Tachycardic, regular, obscured by loud bilateral wheezing with increase in the expiratory phase as well as profuse scattered rhonchi throughout the lung fields. Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, obese, no masses. Mild edema of the lower extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, no rashes. There is a right hand hematoma. Strength is assessed as [Strength] in the lower extremities, [Strength] in the upper extremities with a normal mental status and cognition.\n\n<<<<laboratory>>>>\nLABORATORY STUDIES: White count 19, hematocrit 41, platelets 300. Chem-7: 127 (sodium), 3.6 (potassium), 88 (chloride), 29 (bicarbonate), 17 (BUN), 0.6 (creatinine), 143 (glucose). Troponin was negative. CKs were negative times three. Initial blood gas showed a pH of 7.4, pO2 of 66, pCO2 of 54.\n\nChest x-ray demonstrates a moderate sized hiatal hernia, segmental atelectasis, left lower lobe infiltrate versus segmental atelectasis.\n\nEKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 113 beats per minute, normal axis, no evidence of ST-T wave changes.\n<<<<hospital course>>>>\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:\n1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/dyspnea/pneumonia: The patient was initially placed on an aggressive steroid taper and admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit due to her difficulty with oxygenation despite Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine. She was also given nebulizer treatments every 4 hours as well as chest Physical Therapy (PT). The nebulizers were increased to every 1 hour due to the fact that she continued to have labored breathing.\n\nDue to persistent respiratory failure and labored breathing, the patient was intubated on [Date] in order to improve oxygenation, ventilation, and ability to suction. A bronchoscopy was performed on [Date], which demonstrated marked narrowing of the airways with expiration consistent with tracheomalacia.\n\nOn [Date], two silicone stents were placed, one in the left main stem (12 x 25) and one in the trachea (16 x 40) by Dr. [Name] under rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia.\n\nOn [Date], the patient was extubated to a cool mist shovel mask and her oxygen was titrated down to 2 liters nasal cannula at which time she was transferred to the medical floor. On the medical floor, the steroids were weaned off on [Date], and the patient was saturating at 97% on 2 liters, 92% on room air.\n\nOn [Date], the patient was seen again by the Interventional Pulmonology service, who agreed that she looked much improved and recommended that she go to pulmonary rehabilitation with follow-up within six weeks' time status post placement of stents in respiratory failure.\n\n2. Cardiovascular: The patient was ruled out for a Myocardial Infarction (MI). She did have another episode on the medical floor of chest pain, which showed no evidence of Electrocardiogram (EKG) changes and negative troponin, negative Creatine Kinase (CKs) x3. She was continued on aspirin, Imdur, and diltiazem for rate control per her outpatient regimen.\n\n3. Hypertension: She was maintained on diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide with adequate blood pressure control and normalization of electrolytes.\n\n4. Hematuria: The patient had intermittent hematuria likely secondary to Foley placement. The Foley catheter was discontinued on [Date]. She had serial urinalyses, which were all negative for signs of infection.\n\n5. Hyperglycemia: Patient was placed on insulin-sliding scale due to hyperglycemia, which was steroid induced. This worked quite well and her glucose came back to normal levels once the steroids were tapered off.\n\n6. Leukocytosis: Patient did have a profound leukocytosis of 20 to 22 during much of her hospital course. As the steroids were tapered off, her white blood cell count on [Date] was 15,000. It was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary to both steroids as well as question of a left lower lobe pneumonia.\n\n7. For the left lower lobe pneumonia, the patient had initially received a course of levofloxacin 500 orally once daily from [Date] to [Date]. This was restarted on [Date] for an additional seven-day course given the fact that she still had the leukocytosis and still had marked rales at the left lower lobe.\n\n8. Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on outpatient medical regimen.\n\n9. Depression: The patient was continued on Lexapro per outpatient regimen. It is recommended that she follow up with a therapist as an outpatient due to the fact that she did have a blunted affect throughout much of the hospital course, and did appear clinically to be depressed.\n\n10. Prophylaxis: She was maintained on proton-pump inhibitor with subQ Heparin.\n\n11. Sore throat: The patient did have a sore throat for much of the hospital course post extubation. This was treated with Cepacol lozenges as well as KBL liquid (a solution containing Kaopectate, Bismuth, and lidocaine) at bedtime.\n\n12. Communication/code status: The patient was full code throughout her hospital course, and communication was maintained with the patient and her husband.\n\n13. Muscle weakness: The patient did have profound muscle weakness and was evaluated by Physical Therapy, and was found to have impaired functional mobility, impaired musculoskeletal performance, impaired gas exchange, impaired endurance, impaired ventilation, and needed help with supine to sit. However, she was able to tolerate sitting in a chair for approximately one hour.\n\nOn motor exam, her flexors and extensors of the lower extremities were [Results] at the knee, [Results] at the ankle, [Results] at the elbows, and [Results] hips. It was felt that this weakness was most likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy as well as muscle atrophy secondary to deconditioning after a prolonged hospital course.\n\n14. Speech/swallow: The patient had a Speech and Swallow evaluation showing no evidence of dysphagia, no evidence of vocal cord damage status post tracheal stent placement.\n<<<<discharge condition>>>>\nDISCHARGE CONDITION: The patient was able to oxygenate on room air at 93% at the time of discharge. She was profoundly weak, but was no longer tachycardic and had a normal blood pressure. Her respirations were much improved albeit with transmitted upper airway sounds.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS: The patient will be discharged to [Location] for both pulmonary and physical rehabilitation.\n\n<<<<discharge medication>>>>\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

Over the past five years, she has had progressive difficulties with her breathing. In [Date], she was admitted to [Location] for respiratory failure due to a COPD exacerbation. Due to persistent hypoxemia, she required intubation and an eventual bronchoscopy on [Date] revealed marked narrowing of the airways on expiration consistent with tracheomalacia. She subsequently underwent placement of two silicone stents, one in the left main stem and one in the trachea. During the admission, the patient had complaints of chest pain and ruled out for a Myocardial Infarction (MI). She was subsequently discharged to [Location] for physical and pulmonary rehab. Repeat bronchoscopy on [Date] revealed granulation tissue at the distal right lateral wall of the tracheal stent. There was significant malacia of the peripheral and central airways with complete collapse of the airways on coughing and forced expiration. Small nodules were also noted on the vocal cords. She has noticed improvement in her respiratory status, but most recently has been in discussion with Dr. [Name] regarding possible tracheobronchial plasty with mesh. Tracheal stents discontinued on [Date] in anticipation of surgery. In terms of symptoms, she describes many years of intermittent chest pain that she describes as left-sided and occurring at any time.

Per report, patient felt like this with\nprior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible\npneumonia, but history and CXR not entirely consistent with\nthis. EKG with signs of demand, but ROMI negative. Sputum gram\nstain unremarkable, but respitatory viral culture grew\nparainfluenze type 3 on [**7-24**]. Patient was initially managed on\nsolumedrol 60 mg IV Q8H, and was eventually tapered. With no\nevidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics\nwere stopped [**7-25**]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were\ncontinued around the clock. TTE revealed mild symmetric lvh with\nnormal ef, increased pcwp (>18mmHg), Normal RV, and moderate\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [**7-26**], bronchoscopy\nrevealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had\ndifficulty weaning from the vent, and would become\ninterimittenty hypertensive to SBP 200s and tachypnic to the\n50s. Patient was extubatied on [**7-27**] after passing SBT 0/5, but\nrequired re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening\nsecretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of\nnote, on [**8-1**], the patient was found to have MRSA growing in\nsputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely\nrepresented colonization as opposed to true infection, the\npatient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped\nafter 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's\nfamily and the ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the palliative\ncare service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she\nwould not want a tracheostomy. On [**2124-8-3**], extubation was pursued\nagain and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory\nstatus improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical\nfloor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2LNC with\nnebs (better than her baseline 5L @home). Because of clinical\nexams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently\ndiuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath\nwith tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks\nof anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving prn morphine, her\nbreathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was\nbegun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3\nmore days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4\ndays, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.\n.\n# Upper GI bleeding: On [**7-22**], patient had coffee grounds from OG\ntube.

Patient was continued on IV PPI, with plan for repeat\nEGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved\ngiven abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable\nwith no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the\npatient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to PO\npantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.\n.\n# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness\nat the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and\nthey felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy\nand deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A TSH was\nchecked which was normal.

[**Last Name (STitle) 1407**] was very involved in discussions\nregarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed\nalong with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's\nextubation on [**2124-8-3**], it was decided that the patient would be\nDNR/DNI (although this was later change). The patient's family\nfelt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that\nshe would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status\nwere to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on\ncomfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the\nfloor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with\nintubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated.\nAfter several days with stable or improved overall clinical\nstatus, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation.

This morning patient developed an acute worsening in dyspnea and called Emergency Medical Services (EMS). EMS found patient tachypneic at saturating 90% on 5 liters of oxygen. Patient was noted to be tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the Emergency Room (ER). According to the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently, the patient was without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea (PND), dysuria, diarrhea, confusion, and neck pain. Her husband is a physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning. In the ER, the patient was saturating 96% on Non-Rebreather Mask (NRB). Chest X-ray (CXR) did not reveal any consolidation. Per report, Electrocardiogram (EKG) was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis of 14 and lactate of 2.2. Patient received combivent nebulizers, solumedrol 125 mg Intravenous (IV) once, aspirin 325 mg per os (PO) once, Magnesium Sulfate 2 g IV once, azithromycin 500 mg IV once, levofloxacin 750 mg IV once, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV once. Patient became tachypneic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2 hours. At that time, the patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87%, and tachypneic to the 40s, so the patient was intubated. Post intubation Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) was pH 7.3, pCO2 60, pO2 88, and HCO3 31. Propofol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2 liters of Normal Saline (NS). On transfer, patient Vital Signs (VS) were temperature 102, blood pressure 87/33, oxygen saturation 100% on 60% FiO2, respiratory rate 18, Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 5.

This morning patient developed an acute worsening in dyspnea and called Emergency Medical Services (EMS). EMS found patient tachypneic at saturating 90% on 5 liters of oxygen. Patient was noted to be tripoding. She was given a nebulizer and brought to the Emergency Room (ER). According to the patient's husband, she was experiencing symptoms consistent with prior COPD flares. Apparently, the patient was without cough, chest pain, fevers, chills, orthopnea, Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea (PND), dysuria, diarrhea, confusion, and neck pain. Her husband is a physician and gave her a dose of levaquin this morning. In the ER, the patient was saturating 96% on Non-Rebreather Mask (NRB). Chest X-ray (CXR) did not reveal any consolidation. Per report, Electrocardiogram (EKG) was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis of 14 and lactate of 2.2. Patient received combivent nebulizers, solumedrol 125 mg Intravenous (IV) once, aspirin 325 mg per os (PO) once, Magnesium Sulfate 2 g IV once, azithromycin 500 mg IV once, levofloxacin 750 mg IV once, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV once. Patient became tachypneic so was trialed on non-invasive ventilation but became hypotensive to systolics of 80, so noninvasive was removed and patient did well on NRB and nebulizers for about 2 hours. At that time, the patient became agitated, hypoxic to 87%, and tachypneic to the 40s, so the patient was intubated. Post intubation Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) was pH 7.3, pCO2 60, pO2 88, and HCO3 31. Propofol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam for hypotension to the 80s. Received 2 liters of Normal Saline (NS). On transfer, patient Vital Signs (VS) were temperature 102, blood pressure 87/33, oxygen saturation 100% on 60% FiO2, respiratory rate 18, Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 5.

Per report, patient felt like this with prior COPD exacerbations. Leukocytosis supports possible pneumonia, but history and Chest X-ray (CXR) not entirely consistent with this. Electrocardiogram (EKG) with signs of demand, but Rule Out Myocardial Infarction (ROMI) negative. Sputum gram stain unremarkable, but respiratory viral culture grew parainfluenza type 3 on [Date]. Patient was initially managed on solumedrol 60 mg intravenous (IV) every 8 hours, and was eventually tapered. With no evidence of pneumonia on CXR and sputum gram stain, antibiotics were stopped on [Date]. Beta-agonists and anticholinergics were continued around the clock. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with normal ejection fraction (EF), increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (>18mmHg), Normal Right Ventricle (RV), and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. On [Date], bronchoscopy revealed collapsible, unremarkable airways. Patient had difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and would become intermittently hypertensive to Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) in the 200s and tachypneic to the 50s. Patient was extubated on [Date] after passing Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) 0/5, but required re-intubation 30 minutes later for worsening secretions, lack of gag reflex, and tachypnea to the 50s. Of note, on [Date], the patient was found to have Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) growing in sputum samples. Although it was felt that this likely represented colonization as opposed to true infection, the patient was started on a course of vancomycin (which was stopped after 5 days). After multiple discussions between the patient's family and the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) team, the patient's Primary Care Physician (PCP), [Name] the palliative care service, the patient's family ultimately decided that she would not want a tracheostomy. On [Date], extubation was pursued again and was successful. After extubation, her respiratory status improved and she was ultimately called out to the medical floor. On the floor she was progressively weaned to 2 liters of nasal cannula (LNC) with nebulizers (better than her baseline 5L at home). Because of clinical exams revealing mild volume overload, she was intermittently diuresed. She also experienced intermittent shortness of breath with tachypnea but this was thought to be the result of attacks of anxiety with tachypnea. After receiving as needed (prn) morphine, her breathing status would typically improve. A steroid taper was begun. The patient should continue prednisone 30 mg daily for 3 more days, then 20 mg daily for 4 days, then 10 mg daily for 4 days, then 5 mg daily for 4 days, then stop.\n\n# Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding: On [Date], patient had coffee grounds from Orogastric (OG) tube. Lavage for approximately 600ccs with clearance. Gastrointestinal (GI) performed Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed esophagitis, ulcers and blood in the stomach body, D2 diverticulum and large hiatal hernia. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was negative. Patient was continued on intravenous (IV) Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), with plan for repeat EGD in 8 weeks, and upper GI series once clinically improved given abnormal anatomy on EGD. Her hematocrit remained stable with no further episodes of upper GI bleeding throughout the patient's hospitalization. On the floor she was switched to oral (PO) pantoprazole twice daily. Aspirin was held.\n\n# Weakness: The patient was found to have generalized weakness at the end of her hospitalization. Neurology was consulted and they felt it was likely due to a combination of steroid myopathy and deconditioning from her prolonged bedbound status. A Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) was checked which was normal. They recommended pulmonary and physical rehab.\n\n# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): History of Left Anterior Descending (LAD) and Right Coronary Artery (RCA) stenosis on Cardiac Catheterization (Cath), but no stents. Continued statin and beta blocker, but held aspirin for GI bleeding (see above).\n\n# Nutrition: Unable to pass Nasogastric (NG) tube without direct visualization due to hiatal hernia. Interventional Radiology (IR) guided post pyloric NG tube was placed on [Date] for Tube Feedings (TFs) and PO medications. NG tube was pulled when patient was extubated on [Date]. Speech and swallow were consulted following the patient's extubation and she was eventually moved to soft solids and thin liquids with 1:1 supervision.\n\n# Goals of care: Primary Care Physician (PCP) [Name] was very involved in discussions regarding patient's code status. Palliative care also followed along with the patient. Ultimately, at the time of the patient's extubation on [Date], it was decided that the patient would be Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI) (although this was later changed). The patient's family felt that she would not want a tracheostomy. It was decided that she would not be reintubated and that, if her respiratory status were to worsen after intubation, care would be focused on comfort. However, her status improved in the MICU and on the floor and it was then decided that she would remain DNR with intubation (but no tracheostomy) if her breathing deteriorated. After several days with stable or improved overall clinical status, she was deemed suitable for rehabilitation. At the time of discharge, the patient's code status was do not resuscitate, okay to intubate.\n<<<<medications on admission>>>>\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Omeprazole (OME) 20 mg daily\n2.

Fracture of the C6 (Cervical 6) as described involving the right pedicle (vertebral arch) (extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7 facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.\n\n2. Lucency in the right posterior C1 (Cervical 1) ring may represent a chronic injury. Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 (Thoracic 2) pedicle on the left.\n\n3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments with compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is further described above.\n\nCT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([Date]) ([Time])\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.\n2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.\n3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non-emergent basis.\n4. Bilateral renal cysts.\n5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra. Recommend emergent repositioning.\n\nCT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([Date])\n1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.\n2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe. Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.\n3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate with CT C-spine performed concurrently.\n\nHEAD CT ([Date])\n1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.\n2. Left frontal scalp hematoma.\n3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from facial bone CT scan.\n4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to dedicated CT C-spine for further detail.\n5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old infarction.\n\nCHEST ([Date])\nThe Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid within the major fissure.\n\nCT HEAD ([Date])\n1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend follow-up imaging.\n2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.\n3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.\n4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated maxillofacial CT.\n\nRIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([Date])\nMild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis. Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis, intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the subscapularis tendon.\nIncreased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest CT.\n\nRIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([Date])\n1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the right cephalic vein.\n2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual sonographic features somewhat suspicious for malignancy. Follow-up ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.\nCT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly. There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and adrenal glands are unremarkable. A nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air. There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle, tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.\n\nCT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged, measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free fluid.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large acetabular osteophytes.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Stable bilateral pleural effusions, loculated on the right.\n2. New focus of air tracking within the left rectus muscle with associated tiny amount of extraperitoneal air (2:53). No associated stranding or fluid collection. Please correlate clinically if this could be iatrogenic, such as due to subcutaneous injections.\n3. 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic body. This could represent focal fat, although a cystic tumor cannot be excluded. If this is of concern, then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is again recommended for further evaluation.\n4. Hypoattenuating focus in the left lobe of the liver, too small to accurately characterize.\n5. Bilateral partially exophytic renal cysts.\n6. Moderate amount of dried stool within the rectum.\n\nA wet read was placed and the pertinent findings were discussed by Dr. [Name] with Dr. [Name] at 11:30 p.m. on [Date].\n\n[Date]\nVIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW FINDINGS: Real-time video fluoroscopic evaluation was performed after oral administration of thin and puree consistency of barium, in conjunction with the speech pathologist.\n\nORAL PHASE: Normal bolus formation, bolus control, anterior-posterior (AP) tongue movement, oral transit time, and no oral cavity residue.\nPHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is normal swallow initiation and velar elevation. There is mild-to-moderate impairment of laryngeal elevation with absent epiglottic deflection. There is moderate-to-severe increase in pharyngeal transit time. There is residue in the valleculae and piriform sinuses with moderate impairment of bolus propulsion. There was aspiration of both thin and puree barium.\n\nIMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin liquids and puree. For additional information, please see the speech and swallow therapist's report from the same day.\n\n[Date] CT Head w/out:\nFINDINGS: There is a small amount of blood layering in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles, unchanged though not as dense given evolution. No new hemorrhage is identified. The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are enlarged secondary to involutional change. Periventricular white matter hyperdensities are sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemia. Encephalomalacia in the left cerebellar hemisphere secondary to old infarction is unchanged. The osseous structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Skin staples are noted along the superior-posterior neck secondary to recent spinal surgery.\n\nIMPRESSION: No interval change with a very small intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\nNo discharge labs as patient CMO.\n\n<<<<brief hospital course>>>>\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. [Name] was seen at [Location] after his fall from a height of approximately 10 feet. CT scans of his chest, abdomen and pelvis were negative for pathology. CT scan of his C-spine showed fracture of anterior and posterior elements at C6-7. He was also shown to have a right nasal bone fracture.\n\nC-spine fracture: Mr. [Name] had two surgical procedures to stabilize his c-spine. First, anterior cervical decompression/fusion at C6-7. Second, cervical laminectomy C6-C7 & T1 with Posterior cervical arthrodesis C4-T1. He tolerated the procedures well. He was extubated without complication.\n\nAfter his surgical procedures, Mr. [Name] was transferred to the medicine service at [Location] for his medical care. While on the medicine service, patient was found to be persistently aspirating and failed his speech and swallow evaluation.

On admission her daughters were in disagreement over her code status and her original long standing Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate (DNR/DNI) status was changed to allow for intubation if needed. However, when the patient's respiratory status continued to decline to the point of need for intubation, the patient refused intubation. Her family was notified and agreed that their mother's wishes should be fulfilled. She was started on intravenous morphine then converted to morphine drip on Hospital Day #3 for comfort and all other medications were discontinued. Her family was at her bedside and their Rabbi was called. She died on [Date] at 2:20 pm. An autopsy was offered, but the family declined.\n\n<<<<medications on admission>>>>\nMedications on Admission:\nACETAMINOPHEN 1000 mg Every 6 hours as needed\nALPRAZOLAM 0.25MG Every night as needed\nASPIRIN 81 MG\nCALCIUM CARBONATE 500 mg By mouth twice a day\nFLUOXETINE 10 MG Every night\nFUROSEMIDE 40 mg Once a day\nIMDUR 30MG Once a day\nLIPITOR 40MG Once a day\nLISINOPRIL 10MG Once a day\nMECLIZINE HCL 12.5MG Three times a day as needed\nMULTIVITAMIN\nOMEPRAZOLE 20 mg Once a day\nWARFARIN Every night dosed daily\n\n<<<<discharge medication>>>>\nDischarge Medications:\nNA\n\n<<<<discharge disposition>>>>\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\n<<<<discharge diagnosis>>>>\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPneumonia\n\n<<<<discharge condition>>>>\nDischarge Condition:\nExpired\n\n<<<<discharge instruction>>>>\nDischarge Instructions:\nNA\n\n<<<<follow-up>>>>\nFollow-up Instructions:\nNA\n\nMD"}, "181": {"note": "Admission Date:  [**2150-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-3-1**]\n\nDate of Birth:  [**2086-12-19**]             Sex:   M\n\nService: NEUROSURGERY\n\nAllergies:\nNo Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions\n\nAttending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]\nChief Complaint:\nleft sided brain lesion\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedure:\n[**2-25**] Left Craniotomy for mass resection\n\n\nHistory of Present Illness:\n[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1852**] is a 62-year-old left-handed man who is here for a\nfollow up of his left sphenoid meningioma.

He also\nhas severe peripheral arterial disease s/p peripheral bypass\nsurgery. He presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital ER this morning with\nshortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart\nfailure.\n\nHe states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last\nevening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed\nmoderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest\nassociated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dypsnea. The pain was\nfairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sL NTG at\n6 am by EMS. He has been pain free since. Presenting vitals BP\n109/66, HR 71, O2 sat 88% on RA. CXR showed congestive heart\nfailure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, CK 70.\nHe given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg IV (with ~600cc diuresis),\nNitropaste [**1-3**]\", and Lovenox 80 mg SQ. During the ambulance\ntransfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], he also received ~500 cc IVF for ? low\nBP).\n\nOn further questioning, Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] has very poor exercise\ntolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis.\nBut he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last\nnight) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat,\ncarrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to\nwalk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated\nwith dyspnea and is relieved with few minutes rest. His symptoms\noccur about every day to every other day and have been stable\nover the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal\ndyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify\nthe amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and\nfeels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.\n\nROS is also positive for a nose bleed requiring ED visit several\nmonths ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and\ncurrently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1. Coronary artery disease s/p CABG twice (vide infra).\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Diabetes mellitus.\n4. Hyperlipidemia.\n5.

Stump occlusion of a\ngraft presumably to the right system as well as one stump that\ncould be documented of a graft to the left. Other SVG's were not\nable to be selectively engaged. Supravalvular aortography\ndemonstrated no other patent grafts. Patent LIMA to mid-LAD,\nwhich also back-perfused the diagonal via a patent jump graft\nthat was interposed between the LAD and the diagonal.\n\nSocial History:\nSocial history is significant for the absence of current tobacco\nuse. There is no history of alcohol abuse.\n\nFamily History:\nThere is extensive family history of early coronary disease\n(father died of MI at 44, one brother died in 40's, one in 50's,\nsister had stroke).\n\nPhysical Exam:\nGen: Elderly white male in NAD.

Intraventricular\nconduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave\nchanges most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy.\nCompared to the previous tracing of [**2124-4-9**] ventricular premature\nbeats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical\ncorrelation is suggested.\n\nCXR [**2125-2-9**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG.\nThe heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the\nprevious study.  Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward\nthe lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate- to-severe\npulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also\nnew, most likely part of the heart failure.   Left and right\nretrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.\n\nECHO [**2125-2-11**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.\nThere is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction\nwith akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolaterl\nwalls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF\n= 25-30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.\nTissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular\nfilling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size\nis normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The\naortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe\naortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation\nis seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to\nmoderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no\npericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images\nunavailable of [**2119-5-8**], left ventricular systolic function is now\ndepressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a 84 yo man with CAD s/p CABG twice with daily\nangina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive\nheart failure.\n\n# CAD: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup\nand treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on\nadmission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a\nstably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart\nfailure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10\nmg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this\nwell, however at approximately 8 pm on [**2125-2-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1858**] was\ntransferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest\npain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being\nevaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and\ndeveloped pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were\nstarted, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became\nresponsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to\nbe atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the\n50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that\nhe had developed atrial fibillation earlier in the evening\nwithout obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his\narrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the\nsetting of heart failure and aortic stenosis).  On transfer to\nthe CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and\namiodarone IV for AFib. Chest x-ray on [**2125-2-10**] showed interval\nworsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and\nbibasilar atelectasis.  At this time his cardiac enzymes became\nvery elevated with EKG changes consistent of a NSTEMI with a CK\nto 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [**2125-2-11**], he had a transthoracic\nechocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular\nsystolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the\ninferior and inferolateral walls. LVEF was 25-30 %, with severe\naortic stenosis and [**1-3**]+ mitral regurgitation. He was\naggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in\nhis oxygen requirement and chest x-ray.  Levophed was\ndiscontinued on [**2-12**], and blood pressures remained stable off\npressors with MAP's 60 - 70.  On [**2125-2-13**], he was transferred\nback to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal\nsinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was\ncontinued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and\nimprovement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no\nshortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was\nmaintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal\natrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in\nthe ICU and relative hypotension with SBP in 90s and low 100s\nupon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to\nrelative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creat 1.7. A\ncardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a\n3rd open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending\nre-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term\nplan was to allow recovery from the current episode and\ndiscussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist\nregarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.\n\nOn [**2-16**], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to\n60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given\n1L NS with no response in BP. The patient was mentating but\nbecame short of breath with IVF. He had worsening EKG changes.\nHe was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood\npressure. He was brought to the catherization laboratory for\npotential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At\nthat point, he suffered a PEA arrest and could not be\nresuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.\n\n# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with\ninitial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He\nwas treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [**2-16**] to\npo Lasix 80 mg po twice daily.\n\n# Rhythm: Patient was in NSR on admission. On HD #2, he had\nchest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above.\nTelemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the\nCCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg po tid to be tapered\nover the subsequent weeks.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined\n(creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7\n- 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).\n\n# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley\nplacement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on\n[**2-16**] with gradual resolution of hematuria.\n\n# Diabetes: Due to acute renal failre, metformin was\ndiscontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding\nscale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.\n\n# Hematoma.

He also has severe peripheral arterial disease status post peripheral bypass surgery. He presented to [Location] Hospital ER this morning with shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to be in heart failure.\nHe states he was in his usual state of health until 10:30 last evening when he woke up feeling cold; 1 hour later he developed moderate to severe sharp chest pain radiating across his chest associated with nausea, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. The pain was fairly constant and did not resolve until he was given sublingual nitroglycerin (sL NTG) at 6 am by EMS. He has been pain-free since. Presenting vitals: blood pressure (BP) 109/66, heart rate (HR) 71, oxygen saturation (O2 sat) 88% on room air (RA). Chest X-ray (CXR) showed congestive heart failure; initial troponin-I was mildly elevated at 0.4, creatine kinase (CK) 70. He was given aspirin and furosemide 80 mg intravenous (IV) (with approximately 600cc diuresis), Nitropaste (Nitroglycerin)___\", and Lovenox (Enoxaparin) 80 mg subcutaneous (SQ). During the ambulance transfer to the [Location], he also received approximately 500 cc intravenous fluids (IVF) for ? low BP).\nOn further questioning, Mr. [Name] has very poor exercise tolerance due to knee pain that he attributes to osteoarthritis. But he says that he gets chest pain (similar to pain he had last night) with fairly minimal exertion (picking up his 11 lb cat, carrying 1 gallon jug of water, first getting up from sitting to walk outside or to walk to the bedroom). The pain is associated with dyspnea and is relieved with a few minutes' rest. His symptoms occur about every day to every other day and have been stable over the past year. He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, but does endorse exertional dyspnea (he cannot identify the amount of exertion required). Currently, he is dyspneic and feels somewhat better sitting up; he reports no chest pain.\nReview of Systems (ROS) is also positive for a nose bleed requiring emergency department (ED) visit several months ago (and cessation of Plavix for a few days), and currently gross hematuria after Foley placement and Lovenox.\nPast Medical History:\n1.

There are also frequent atrial premature beats. Intraventricular conduction defect. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes most likely related to left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [Name] ventricular premature beats are more frequent, as are atrial premature beats. Clinical correlation is suggested.\n\nCXR [Date]: The patient is after median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft. The heart size appears slightly enlarged compared to the previous study. Bilateral perihilar haziness continues toward the lower lungs is new consistent with new moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema. Bilateral pleural effusion is present, also new, most likely part of the heart failure. Left and right retrocardiac opacities consistent with atelectasis.\n\nECHO [Date]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction = 25-30%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure > 18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.6 cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior report (images unavailable of [Name]), left ventricular systolic function is now depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a 84 year old man with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) status post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) twice with daily angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure.\n\n# CAD: The patient was transferred to [Location] for further workup and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10 mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this well, however at approximately 8 pm on [Date], Mr. [Name] was transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the 50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that he had developed atrial fibrillation earlier in the evening without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis). On transfer to the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and amiodarone IV for atrial fibrillation. Chest x-ray on [Date] showed interval worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. At this time his cardiac enzymes became very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) with a Creatine Kinase (CK) to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [Date], he had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) was 25-30 %, with severe aortic stenosis and [Abbreviation]+ mitral regurgitation. He was aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray. Levophed was discontinued on [Date], and blood pressures remained stable off pressors with Mean Arterial Pressures (MAP's) 60 - 70. On [Date], he was transferred back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in the ICU and relative hypotension with Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) in 90s and low 100s upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creatinine 1.7. A cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a third open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.\n\nOn [Date], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to 60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given 1L Normal Saline (NS) with no response in Blood Pressure (BP). The patient was mentating but became short of breath with Intravenous Fluids (IVF). He had worsening EKG changes. He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood pressure. He was brought to the catheterization laboratory for potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At that point, he suffered a Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) arrest and could not be resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.\n\n# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [Date] to oral Lasix 80 mg twice daily.\n\n# Rhythm: Patient was in Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) on admission. On HD #2, he had chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above. Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg three times a day orally to be tapered over the subsequent weeks.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined (creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7 - 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).\n\n# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley placement at the outside hospital.

Compared with the prior report (images unavailable of [Name]), left ventricular systolic function is now depressed and the severity of aortic stenosis has increased.\n<<<<brief hospital course>>>>\nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a 84 year old man with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) status post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) twice with daily angina, presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure.\n\n# CAD: The patient was transferred to [Location] for further workup and treatment of chest pain. A chest X-ray performed on admission showed moderate-severe pulmonary edema. He did have a stably elevated troponin thought to be related to acute heart failure or demand ischemia. He was started on a Lasix drop at 10 mg/hr for initiation of diuresis. He initially tolerated this well, however at approximately 8 pm on [Date], Mr. [Name] was transferred from the floor to the CCU after complaining of chest pain when he was sitting in bed after dinner. As he was being evaluated by the housestaff, he became unresponsive and developed pulseless electrical arrest. Chest compressions were started, but within approximately 2 minutes, he became responsive and regained a palpable pulse. His rhythm appeared to be atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate initially in the 50s but rising to the 110's. Review of his telemetry showed that he had developed atrial fibrillation earlier in the evening without obvious ventricular arrhythmias immediately prior to his arrest (which was attributed to a vasovagal episode in the setting of heart failure and aortic stenosis). On transfer to the CCU, he was started on levophed for hypotension and amiodarone IV for atrial fibrillation. Chest x-ray on [Date] showed interval worsening of pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. At this time his cardiac enzymes became very elevated with EKG changes consistent of a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) with a Creatine Kinase (CK) to 1006 and troponin to 3.82. On [Date], he had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) was 25-30 %, with severe aortic stenosis and [Abbreviation]+ mitral regurgitation. He was aggressively diuresed with an IV Lasix drip with improvement in his oxygen requirement and chest x-ray. Levophed was discontinued on [Date], and blood pressures remained stable off pressors with Mean Arterial Pressures (MAP's) 60 - 70. On [Date], he was transferred back to the floor team on PO amiodarone. He remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry on po amiodarone, and diuresis was continued with a Lasix drip with good urine output and improvement of renal function. He remained asymptomatic with no shortness of breath or chest pain after transfer. He was maintained on a heparin drip bridging to Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. His metoprolol was held for hypotension in the ICU and relative hypotension with Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) in 90s and low 100s upon transfer to the floor. ACE-inhibitor was held due to relative hypotension and renal insufficiency with Creatinine 1.7. A cardiac surgery consult deemed him an acceptable candidate for a third open heart surgery for aortic valve replacement pending re-assessment of his coronary anatomy. The intermediate-term plan was to allow recovery from the current episode and discussion as an outpatient with his primary cardiologist regarding the risks and benefits of aortic valve replacement.\n\nOn [Date], the patient became hypotensive to SBPs to 60s-70s after getting into a chair after breakfast. He was given 1L Normal Saline (NS) with no response in Blood Pressure (BP). The patient was mentating but became short of breath with Intravenous Fluids (IVF). He had worsening EKG changes. He was started on Levophed without improvement in his blood pressure. He was brought to the catheterization laboratory for potential emergent aortic valvuloplasty and was intubated. At that point, he suffered a Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) arrest and could not be resuscitated. He was pronounced deceased at 12:33pm.\n\n# Pump: As above. The patient had severe pulmonary edema with initial exam revealing crackles throughout his lung fields. He was treated with a Lasix drip which was transitioned on [Date] to oral Lasix 80 mg twice daily.\n\n# Rhythm: Patient was in Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) on admission. On HD #2, he had chest pain, then went into PEA arrest as described above. Telemetry showed atrial fibrillation prior to the event. In the CCU, he was started on amiodarone 400 mg three times a day orally to be tapered over the subsequent weeks.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Renal function initially declined (creatinine to 2.1), then improved on Lasix gtt, but stayed 1.7 - 1.9 (above baseline of 1.3).\n\n# Hematuria: He had hematuria (no clots) after traumatic Foley placement at the outside hospital. The catheter was removed on [Date] with gradual resolution of hematuria.\n\n# Diabetes: Due to acute renal failure, metformin was discontinued and the patient was maintained on a Humalog sliding scale with 30 units of Lantus at bedtime.\n\n# Hematoma: The patient developed a small hematoma at the site of his right internal jugular venous access after catheter removal. This was treated with local compression.\n<<<<medications on admission>>>>\nMedications on Admission:\nAspirin (ASA) 81 mg\nPlavix (Clopidogrel) 75 mg\nAtenolol 50 mg\nIsordil (Isosorbide Dinitrate) 5 mg___\nHydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg daily\nLisinopril 40 mg\nGemfibrozil 600 mg\nSimvastatin 20 mg\nGlipizide 5 mg Extended Release (XL) daily\nMetformin unknown dose\nProtonix 40 mg\nThiamine, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B6, Folate\n\n<<<<discharge medication>>>>\nDischarge Medications:\nNone\n\n<<<<discharge disposition>>>>\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\n<<<<discharge diagnosis>>>>\nDischarge Diagnosis:\n1) Severe aortic stenosis\n2) Coronary artery disease with non-ST segment myocardial infarction\n3) Cardiogenic shock requiring pressor support\n4) Atrial fibrillation\n5) Pulseless electrical activity arrest, twice\n6) Severe acute on chronic left ventricular systolic and diastolic heart failure\n7) Acute on chronic renal failure\n8) Traumatic hematuria\n9) Diabetes mellitus\n10) Hypertension\n11) Peripheral arterial disease\n12) Hyperlipidemia\n\n<<<<discharge condition>>>>\nDischarge Condition:\nDeceased\n\n<<<<discharge instruction>>>>\nDischarge Instructions:\nNone\n\n<<<<followup instruction>>>>\nFollowup Instructions:\nNone\n\n[Name], MSC 12-339."}}
